I have no idea what I am doing :)

Currently most inspired by [ryan4yin's configs](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config) as a starting point.
Need to change a lot before actually making this switch to nixos...

**Nothing is working**

Still thinking about:

- Should home-manager config be separate from nix modules for each "program"?
