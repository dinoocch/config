# Nix flake libs

From `ryan4yin/nix-config`, used basically directly:

- `colmenaSystem` - Host definition as expected by `colmena`
- `darwinSystem` - Host definition as expected by `nix-darwin`
- `nixosSystem` - Host definition as expected by `nisosSystem` (local)

They're all super similar though so maybe I'll change it someday as I learn more about nix
